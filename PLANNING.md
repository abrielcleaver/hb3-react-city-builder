## The Golden Rule:
ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Stop starting and start finishing. üèÅ

***If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.***

### Terminal Commands
npm i
npm start
npm test
git status
git commit -m "
git push origin -u dev
git reset --soft HEAD~1 
    - removes the last commit from the current branch - use only if commit hasn't been pushed
    - use if the commit being reset ONLY exists locally. This command changes the commit history and it might overwrite history 

git revert < commit to revert >
    - find the name of the commit you want to revert using git log
    - creates a new commit that undoes the changes, so if the commit to revert has already been pushed to a shared repository, it is best to use revert as it doesn't overwrite commit history.

### To-do:
- [x] npm i
- [x] make dev branch
- [x] generate netlify deploy site
- [x] add netlify link to github repo


- /App
  - [x] tracks state for `skylineId`, `waterfrontId`, `castleId`, `slogans`, and `cityName`
  - passes state as props correctly to 
    - [X] `CityNameInput` and 
    - [x] `City`, 
    - [x] `SloganForm`, 
    - [x] `SloganList` 
- /City
  - [x] use the 3 props to render the correct images that live in the `public` directory
- /CityNameInput({ setCityName }) : 
  - [x] on change, call setCityName with the new e.target.value to change App.js state

- image changes when selected from dropdown
  - [x] waterfront
  - [x] skyline
  - [x] castle

- /SloganForm
  - `SloganForm({ setSlogans, slogans })`
    - [x] tracks state for the current slogan being typed
     - [x] OnChange of the input, this state changes
    - [x] On submit of the form, this slogan is injected into `App.js` state using a callback state handler passed down as a prop
- /SloganList
  - `SloganList({ slogans })`
    - [x] maps through the `slogans` prop and renders a `Slogan` for each item in the array
- /Slogan
  - `Slogan({ slogan} )`
    - [x] renders the `slogan` prop

### Stretch goal ideas:
- Write two components: `OrderForm` (to hold all the input components) and `OrderDisplay` (to show the user what is selected). Import the appropriate components into these components so that App.js is only responsible for: 
  1) initializing state 
  2) calling `OrderForm` and `OrderDisplay` and
  3) passing the correct props to `OrderForm` and `OrderDisplay`.
- Write a component called `Dropdown`. Use this component to replace all 3 of your dropdowns. Ask yourself: what differs between these 3 dropdowns? The answer to that question will tell you what props your abstracted `Dropdown` component will need to be passed. This is a challenge :)
- Add a `Submit Order` button. The app will clear the current order and keep track of all past orders and render them to the page (like soccer scorekeeper).
